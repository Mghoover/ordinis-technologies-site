# Ordinis Technologies Marketing Site (Multi-page)

A quiet, institutional marketing site built as a **site**, not a single long scroll.

## What’s in here

- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- Minimal CSS (no Tailwind, no animations, no “SaaS hype”)
- Pages:
  - `/` (Home)
  - `/core-practice`
  - `/architecture` (drafted in full)
  - `/security`
  - `/company`
  - `/contact`

## Local dev

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open:

- http://localhost:3000

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Notes

- Replace the placeholder contact email once you’ve set up your domain inbox.
- The design is intentionally restrained. If you add visuals later, keep them structural (grids, rules, diagrams), not “marketing gradients.”
